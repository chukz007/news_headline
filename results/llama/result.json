        "news_body": "Democratic state attorney generals and environmental groups are gearing up for what is expected to be a precedent-setting legal battle with the Trump administration over its rollback of an Obama-era power plant pollution rule. They argue the new Trump rule won't do enough to stop climate change and that the administration is ignoring the Clean Air Act's (CAA) requirement that the federal government manage pollution that is harmful to human health. There are high stakes. A loss on their side could limit the EPA's ability to address climate changing pollution in administrations to come, an outcome the Trump EPA is banking on. \"If it's upheld, this new highly constrained legal interpretation that they've put forward here could really hinder the use of the Clean Air Act in the future as a tool for reducing climate-changing pollution,\" said Lissa Lynch, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). NRDC is one of a handful of environmental groups, along with a number of state attorney generals who have said they plan to sue over the rule. The EPA's new rule is a replacement for former President Obama's Clean Power Plan (CPP) rule, which targeted emissions from coal plants and sought to move the country from its reliance on coal. The rule never took effect amid a number of legal challenges that are still moving through the courts. The replacement rule, unveiled by the Trump EPA on Wednesday, is designed to give states more time and authority to decide how to implement new technology to ease net emissions from coal-fired plants. The Trump administration argues that the Obama rule was too extreme, and their emissions replacement, the American Clean Energy (ACE) rule, focuses more narrowly on technology power plants can use to reduce their pollution. \"This regulation does not cap emissions, does not set a state-wide cap or a facility cap - we don't cap emissions, we limit emissions rates,\" a top EPA official told reporters on a call the day the ACE rule was announced. The decision not to cap emissions under the final rule has critics up in arms. They note that the CAA requires the EPA to regulate pollution from sources the agency has determined endangers public health and welfare. The agency has included power plants as one such source since the 1970s. The CAA requires such challenges within 60 days after a rule has been filed. At least nine attorneys general have criticized the new rule and are expected to file lawsuits soon. \"The coal lobbyists and climate deniers running the Trump Administration wrote every word of this unjustifiable and illegal rule that will pollute the air, explode emissions, and cost thousands of lives,\" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said in a statement. \"Massachusetts is committed to addressing the climate crisis and the public health impacts on our residents, and we will be suing to stand up for science and federal law.\" The legal battle will largely boil down to how much action the CAA requires of the EPA. The EPA will likely argue that Obama's rule stepped beyond its authority by trying to shift more power generation to renewable sources. \"It looked at the power sector as a whole and relied upon the idea that the regulation could effectively force reductions at coal plants,\" the senior EPA official said. \"We believe this is not legal and goes well beyond our authority of the Clean Air Act.\" The EPA wants to limit regulations to things physically connected to power plant operations. But Lynch, with the NRDC, said that would stymie future administrations from addressing climate change. \"What they want is a court ruling that says the best system of emission reduction is limited to these tiny minor tweaks that do nothing, and then the EPA can do nothing going forward to address pollution,\" she said. \"That's what the EPA wants.\" Lawyers planning to sue over ACE say the rule is so weak it ignores EPA's legal obligation to address harmful pollution. They will argue that the law compels the agency to take tougher steps. \"The statute requires maximum feasible emissions reduction,\" said Andres Restrepo, a lawyer with the Sierra Club, which is also planning to sue over ACE. \"This comes nowhere near doing that.\" Restrepo said the law allows for a program that includes broader policy measures that could be implemented outside of the four walls of a coal plant. \"Power plants can run less frequently, less intensely; there can be renewable generation that fills up the gaps,\" he said. Restrepo said a court ruling could span a number of possibilities. Rather than siding squarely with environmentalists or the agency, a court could rule that ACE is just one of the appropriate ways EPA can interpret the CAA. Joseph Goffman, one of the original drafters of the CAA and a former associate assistant administrator for climate in EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under Obama, said the EPA is taking \"an extremely limited read\" of the law. He said the EPA will likely welcome a lawsuit in the hopes that courts could clarify that the agency does not need to regulate emissions in the way Obama attempted. \"This isn't anything other than the current leadership at EPA trying to establish a legal precedent,\" he said in a call with reporters earlier this week. The EPA did not respond to a request for comment. Goffman cautioned though that the legal outcome would be hard to predict. \"I don't think either side can anticipate a slam dunk,\" he said.",

        "news_body": "We love old houses. Their architectural styles tell stories of the past, and their classic character feels familiar and welcoming. A house with a history behind it is a major draw for many potential buyers. Some aspects of an old home, however, can feel outdated rather than retro . Stepping through the front door of a 1970s rancher can often feel like a time warp. While keeping the home's original character is important, it's necessary to make some updates so you don't feel stuck in another decade. Repainting the exterior, for example, is an easy way to freshen up an older home. There are some interior design trends  wood paneling, popcorn ceilings, vertical blinds that should be left in the past for good. The one thing that will immediately make your home look outdated is the material of your kitchen countertops. Busy granite instantly ages a space. The dizzying pattern of the heavy slabs becomes an unwelcome focal point and usually overpowers the rest of the room. Picking a backsplash that doesn't clash with a busy granite pattern poses another challenge. Natural wooden cabinets are usually paired with these counters, but pine or hickory cabinetry can set the style of your kitchen back a few decades too. Another countertop material that instantly ages your kitchen is tile. Ceramic tile counters crack easily, so they don't stand up to the demands of a hardworking kitchen. Bright white grout easily gets stained by inevitable spills, which can leave even a clean space looking dirty. Unfortunately, replacing kitchen countertops can be pricey. Purchasing remnants of granite, rather than investing in entire slabs, is one way to save money. Or keep the original countertops and freshen up the space in other ways. Repainting cabinetry, for instance, is a more cost-efficient way for bringing a new look (and incorporating some color) to the room.",

        "news_body": "Justin Verlander made headlines earlier in the week when he openly accused Major League Baseball of lying about juicing balls, and he had to have known league officials would not appreciate the remarks. What he may not have known, however, was that he would be scolded over them. As Jayson Stark of The Athletic put it, Verlander got called into the principal's office on Monday afternoon. The veteran right-hander received a stern talking to from Joe Torre, Jim Leyland and at least one other MLB official. Fellow Houston Astros starting pitcher Gerritt Cole said after Tuesday night's All-Star Game that he was the one who informed Verlander the bigwigs were waiting to speak with him. \"I may actually have facilitated that meeting,\" Cole said. \"I saw Jim and Joe were in (manager Alex Cora's) office. And they said hi. Then Jim, in not a profanity-laden way, said, 'Get Justin in here right now.' So I came out and said, 'Hey, Skip wants to see you.' And he said, 'OK.' Then he comes back and he goes, 'Man, I just got chewed out.'\" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred has admitted the balls being used in games are different now than they were several years ago, but he insists no changes were made at the directive of the league. Verlander on Monday called that a \"f-----g joke\" and ridiculed Manfred for denying it even though the league purchased Rawlings   the manufacturer of official game balls   last year. \"Manfred the first time he came in, what'd he say? He said we want more offense,\" Verlander said. \"All of a sudden he comes in, the balls are juiced? It's not coincidence. We're not idiots.\" According to Stark, Torre, Leyland and company essentially told Verlander they love his passion but he doesn't know what he's talking about. That came after Manfred doubled-down on his denial of the league juicing balls and said team owners are actually concerned about the record number of home runs being hit. Verlander isn't the only pitcher who has called upon Major League Baseball to simply admit they're juicing balls, but Manfred is not backing down. One of Verlander's teammates even seemed offended by the juiced ball talk , and Verlander admitted on Tuesday night that \"I need to dig a little further.\" Perhaps he is starting to reconsider his stance.

        "news_body": "LOS ANGELES   O.J. Simpson launched a Twitter account with a video post in which the former football star said he's got a \"little gettin' even to do.\" Simpson confirmed the new account to The Associated Press on Saturday, saying in a phone interview while on a Las Vegas golf course that it \"will be a lot of fun.\" \"I've got some things to straighten out,\" he said. He did not elaborate before he said he had to go and ended the call. Simpson has generally kept a low profile since his release from prison in October 2017 for robbery and kidnapping over an attempt to steal back some of his sports memorabilia from a Las Vegas hotel room. In the Twitter video, Simpson said his followers would get to read all his thoughts and opinions on \"just about everything.\" \"Now, there's a lot of fake O.J. accounts out there,\" he said, adding that this one would be official. He appeared to record the message himself and ended it with a grin. The 71-year-old recently told the AP he was happy and healthy living in Las Vegas 25 years after the killings of his ex-wife and her friend. Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were stabbed to death on the night of June 12, 1994. Simpson was ultimately acquitted of the crime after a televised trial that riveted the nation and raised thorny issues of racism, police misconduct, celebrity and domestic violence. Relatives of the two victims have expressed disgust that Simpson is able to live the way he does. Simpson was ordered to pay $33.5 million for the wrongful deaths of the two victims, but most of the judgment has not been paid. Simpson has continued to declare his innocence in the two slayings. The murder case is officially listed as unsolved. In his recent interview , Simpson told the AP that neither he nor his children want to talk about the killings ever again. \"My family and I have moved on to what we call the 'no negative zone.' We focus on the positives,\" he said. ___ Linda Deutsch is a retired special correspondent for The Associated Press. She covered all of Simpson's legal cases during her 48-year career as a Los Angeles-based trial reporter.",
